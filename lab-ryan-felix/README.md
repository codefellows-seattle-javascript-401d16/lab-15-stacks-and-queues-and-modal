# Exercises - CSS Modals; Stacks and Queues

## CSS Modals

`index.html` and `style.css` contain a demonstration modal.

## Stacks and Queues

`lib/stack.js` and `lib/queue.js` contain a stack and a queue class, respectively. Each depends on `lib/node.js` (not to be confused with NodeJS).

Each adds/removes nodes in O(1) time. Other operations are not implemented at this time.
